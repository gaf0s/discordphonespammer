ok so if your down right dumb this is what you do:
ABOUT: a script that spams a phone number with hundreds of verification codes (will get rate limited a lot so i suggest you use more than 1 token)
to run this script first put in your token in tokens.txt and then well as any human being with a normal iq would do run the python file
if it crashes over a dumbass "package not installed" then pip install everything that is being imported in command prompt and rerun
ok goodbye
PS: if it doesnt work its either skill issue or an error with the script itself. If you have an error then add me on discord: presence#4646
